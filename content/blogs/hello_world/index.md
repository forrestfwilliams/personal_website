Welcome to my blog! My name is Forrest Williams, and I’m excited to introduce myself to you.

I recently graduated from a New Zealand university with a PhD in geology where I studied landslides, but I now find myself working in the fascinating (and confusing) world of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing.

I work at the [Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu) (NASA’s SAR data center), where I am both a scientist and a software developer. It’s a tricky balance at times, but I enjoy the opportunities it gives me to design new SAR data products (check out the [HyP3 project](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu) if you haven’t already!) and to participate in scientific projects that have a truly global scale.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, running, and hanging out with my wonderful wife Jessie.

In this blog, I will be sharing my thoughts on the fascinating world of SAR, scientific software development, and the minutiae of cloud-based data access. Hopefully you’ll find these topics as interesting as I do!

Thanks for taking the time to get to know me, I’m looking forward to sharing my journey with you!
